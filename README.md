Solution to the Banana environment for the assignment of the course 2 of Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree from Udacity.

## Project Details
This project is about the implementation of an agent that navigates in the **Banana** enevironment.   
The rules of the environment are very simple: the agent gets a reward of +1 everytime it collects a yellow banana 
and a reward of -1 everytime it collects a blue banana. Thus the aim of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas 
as possible and avoid blue bananas.

There are 4 available actions:
- `0`: move forward
- `1`: move backward
- `2`: turn left
- `3`: turn right

The state space has 37 dimensions, including agent velocity and perception of the objects around the agent.

The environment is considered solved when the agent obtains a score greater or equal than +13, 
averaged over 100 consecutive episodes.
