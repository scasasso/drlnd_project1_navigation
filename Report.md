# A Double Q-Network (DQN) approach to solve the Banana environment
In order
It's a simple 3-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP), with 256 neurons in each layer. The output dimension reflects the number of discrete actions in the environment. 
The same architecture is used for both local and target network used in the Double Q-Network (approach).
